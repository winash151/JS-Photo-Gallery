# JS Photo Gallery

Select a folder from your computer to upload. Preferably less than 1000 photos worth.

Made for use on touchscreen devices. Use a three-finger tap to exit out of a folder or picture. Swipe along the bottom or top of an image to get the next one.

There is also an option to control using hand gestures through a webcam. You need to hold your palm inside the red square so it can track the color of your palm when swiping left and right.
